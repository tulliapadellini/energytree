Description: The etree package allows to build regression/classification conditional inference trees. 
    The splitting procedure is carried out by means of energy tests, thus allowing for covariates of mixed type. 
    Current implementation covers the case of functions, graphs and persistence diagrams, as well as
    standard categorical and numerical values, as covariates.
