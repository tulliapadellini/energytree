Description: The etree package allows to build regression/classification 
    conditional inference trees. The splitting procedure is carried out by means
    of energy tests, thus allowing for covariates of mixed type. Current 
    implementation takes as covariates functional data, graphs and persistence 
    diagrams, as well as standard categorical and numerical values.
